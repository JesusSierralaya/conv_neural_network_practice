* Convolutional Neural Networks Practice Repository

** Overview
This repository is dedicated to the practice and improvement of deep learning techniques, specifically focusing on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It serves as an academic project aimed at exploring, understanding, and enhancing CNN models for various applications.

** Objectives
- Exploration: To understand the intricacies of CNN architectures and their applications in deep learning.
- Implementation: To apply practical knowledge by coding CNNs using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow.
- Improvement: To enhance existing CNN models by experimenting with different architectures, parameters, and datasets.
- Sharing: To contribute back to the community by documenting the learnings and improvements made during the practice sessions.

** Tools and Technologies
- Python: The primary programming language used for writing the code.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow, which makes experimentation and prototyping quicker and easier.
- TensorFlow: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning that provides comprehensive tools and libraries for building and deploying ML models.

** Getting Started
To get started with this project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   #+END_SRC

2. Install Dependencies:
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries using pip:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   pip install tensorflow keras
   #+END_SRC

3. Verify Installation:
   Run the following Python code within an org file to verify TensorFlow and Keras have been installed correctly. This script checks the TensorFlow version, which is a crucial step before starting your work on CNNs.
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   import tensorflow as tf
   print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
   print("Keras version:", tf.keras.__version__)
   #+END_SRC

4. Explore the Notebooks:
   Navigate through the notebooks to explore the different CNN models and experiments. Document your findings and experiments directly in org mode files for a comprehensive learning and development experience.

** Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or want to share your experiments with CNNs, please feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
